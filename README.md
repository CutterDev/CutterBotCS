# CutterBotCS

This is my own personal project to run a discord bot on my friends community discord server!

This has been written in C# and a bit of SQL to handle the data beiing stored.

Features
- Allows players to register to the Discord bot.
- Registered Players can look up their own history of league of legend games, and their stats on their top 10 champions.

- Registered Players will also be able to see a leaderboard of all players ranks and ordered highest to lowest.
